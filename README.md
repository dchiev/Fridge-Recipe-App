# Fridge-Recipe-App

# Description
The Fridge Recipe App - This application is designed so that everyone can have a recipe to make with the ingredients they currently have in their fridge. Once the ingredients that are available have been searched a recipe is generated that includes: the country of origin, ingredients, instructions, a link to a Youtube video and a picture!

# Implementation
Using the UI Kit as our framework we created a website that contained a nav bar and multiple containers. The first container holds the search area, which uses ajax functions to search 2 api databases to retrieve our recipe. Once the recipe is retreived the name and thumbnail of the recipe are in one container. The second container holds , the country of origin, the instructions and the ingredients. The last container holds the thumbnail for a Youtube video that matches the recipe and a direct link to that video.

# Improvements
There were many ideas that we had floating around but due to time and some issues we came across we had put them on the back burner for the time being. Some further ideas we would like to explore are obtaining more than 1 recipe search result and displaying it on the page, embedding the video link in the thumbnail so that if you click it you are automatically redirected, some more styling and formatting to make the page even more user friendly, we could go on and on, there's always room for improvement.
